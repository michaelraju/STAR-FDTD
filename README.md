This repository hosts the Matlab based Finite Difference Time Domain (*FDTD*) code packages associated with our article titled
“*STAR-FDTD : Space-time modulated acousto-optic guidestar in disordered media*”, Michael Raju, Baptiste Jayet and Stefan Andersson-Engels, Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Ireland. The [article](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7647/ad6ed2) is accepted in *Journal of Physics : Photonics, Focus Issue on Foundational Skills and Tools for Building Wavefront Shaping Systems*. The [user manual](/User_manual.pdf) is provided here within the repository. It is recommended to go through the user manual to understand the directory structure of the code packages.

### Contribution
The code packages and the associated numerical formulations were developed by Michael Raju as part of his [PhD thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10468/14107).
Baptiste Jayet and Prof. Stefan Andersson-Engels were involved in the PhD supervision. 

### Funding
We would like to thank Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) for funding the research through Stefan's professorship grant *"Novel applications and techniques for in-vivo
optical imaging and spectroscopy”* (SFI/15/RP/2828 and SFI/22/RP-2TF/10293).
